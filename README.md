# Ramzor :vertical_traffic_light: :israel:
## An open source app in android for viewing corona stats in Israel easily every day.
### Presented by Ruben Rudov and ([Adam Livne](https://github.com/adamal92)).

The app scrapes and manipulates data from official stats to a comfort and user-friendly interface.
For now the app supports only Hebrew.

### Main app features in V 1.0: 
  - Corona stats view for each city in Israel with a daily update.
  - Corona stats for the whole country.
  - Pie charts for some topic.
  
### Upcoming features in V 1.1:
  - Comparison between cities by the corona parameters per X citizens.
  - More options of stats.
  - "Ramzor" grade for each city when it will be possible.
  
### User guide: 
 - Open the app.
 - Navigate to "לפי עיר".
 - Write the name of the city you prefer to search stats about and tap the search button.
 - Scroll the view down to see the whole stats.
 
 ### For other developers:
  - You can tryout the app yourself but you won't be able to use the data from the database.
  - For trying, download the src/main path and paste in your project instead the main path in your project.
  - The data we've used is from Data.gov.il, you can try scrape the data too.
  - If you have any suggetion, please write us on the email I mention below.
  - If you use interface, please, let us know how it is. :smiley:
  - For now, IOS version isn't in our plans. If you are an IOS developer and you'd like build an IOS version of the app contact us and we'll discuss about it.
  

The app will be fully open source after been published on google play.
Your privacy is important for us, we don't & won't take any kind of data from your phone. 
Tnx for viewing our project.
