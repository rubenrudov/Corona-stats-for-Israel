# Israel Covid-19 live stats.
## Developed by: Ruben Rudov and Adam Livne in 2021.

The purpose of our app is to provide a platform for Israel's citizens for viewing Israel Covid-19 stats (The whole process was finished before the "Ramzor" app was published and the development stopped as soon as the official app was published).

Technologies: Android Studio (Java & XML), Firebase (Database & Site hosting), Python (For Big-Data server).

The app is available for [download](https://rubyadam-df256.firebaseapp.com/), the server was forced down on 27/02/2021.

### Get started:
* Clone the repo
* Create a new Firebase project and connect it to the python server by changing the vitals in the firebaseConfig file.
* Connect the new project to your android project.
* Read your data (In our case it was from israel's data.gov site).
* Have fun and keep hacking ðŸ™‚ !
