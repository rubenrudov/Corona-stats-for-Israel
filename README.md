# HaRamzor :vertical_traffic_light: :israel:
## An open source app in android for viewing corona stats in Israel easily every day.
### Presented by Ruben Rudov and [Adam Livne](https://github.com/adamal92).

The app goal is be a comfort and user-friendly platform for viewing corona-virus stats in Israel.
The app is using a big-data research server for scraping and saving of data from a reliable source of information.
The data was taken and was re-formatted from data.gov.il.
### Important: for now the app supports only Hebrew.

### Main app features in V 1.0: 
  - Corona stats view for each city in Israel with a daily update.
  - Graphs for some topics.
  - List of red and green countries with filtering option.
  
  
### Upcoming features in V 1.1:
  - Comparison between cities by the corona parameters per X citizens.
  - More options of stats like the % of the positive corona tests in each city.
  - "Ramzor" grade for each city when it will be possible for us.
  
### User guide for the by-city filtering feature and the countries list feature: 
 - Open the app.
 - Navigate to "לפי עיר".
 - Write the name of the city you prefer to search stats about and tap the search button.
 - Scroll the view down to see the whole stats.
 - If you'd like to check if there are grren countries go to: "רשימה מדינות"
 - Filter by the keyword "ירוק"
 
 
 ### For other developers:
  - You can tryout the app yourself but you won't be able to use the data from the database.
  - For trying, download the src/main path and paste in your project instead the main path in your project.
  - The data we've used is from Data.gov.il, you can try scrape the data too.
  - If you have any suggetion, please write us on the email I mention below.
  - If you use interface, please, let us know how it is. :smiley:
  - For now, IOS version isn't in our plans. If you are an IOS developer and you'd like build an IOS version of the app contact us and we'll discuss about it.
  

The app will be fully open source after been published on google play.
Your privacy is important for us, we don't & won't take any kind of data from your phone.
